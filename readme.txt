This project was created by Rach Taylor and is the Capstone project for the Codecademy course in the class "Build Websites From Scratch" 2018.

Scope was given in form of a simple wireframe spec. The task was to showcase an elegant user interface for the project, using all structural code techniques taught throughout the course. This includes:

- Setting up a new project in the local environment
- Setting up remote Github for file storage and presentation
- Using the command line
- Structure and semantics of HTML
- ARIA roles and labels for accessibility
- Flexbox for positioning and responsive site design
- CSS styling, including pseudo selectors and transitions
- Linking external stylesheets
